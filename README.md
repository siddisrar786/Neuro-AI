## 🧬 How Our AI Works

1. **MRI Image Upload**  
   Upload a T1-weighted axial brain MRI scan (standard DICOM/JPEG format).

2. **RegNet-150 Image Analysis**  
   The RegNet-150 CNN processes MRI scans and detects patterns with >99% accuracy.

3. **TxGemma Symptom Evaluation**  
   The LLM analyzes user-provided clinical symptoms (textual input).

4. **Multimodal Fusion**  
   Predictions from both models are fused for improved accuracy.

5. **Diagnosis Report**  
   Users receive a visual and textual AI-generated report (PDF or HTML).
